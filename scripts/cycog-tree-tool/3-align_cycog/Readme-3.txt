The genes within the cycog fasta will have similar regions of their sequences.
These regions are not necessarily located at the same position within the sequence, however.
The purpose of alignment is to align these similar regions with each other.
Alignment is necessary for phylogenetic analysis.
This step is currently performed using Jalview. We may look into tools in the future to automate this.
